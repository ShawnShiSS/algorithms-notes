# Algorithms Notes in C#
Summary notes on top interview questions on data structures and algorithms in C# for study purpose.

## Goal
Organize the C# solutions to the most-frequently-asked data structure and algorithms questions by category, with heavy comments on
- time complexity and space complexity
- edge cases handling
- key points to avoid bugs
- bug free templates
